We created a lean form which calculates the cost of a legal consultation based on time and complexity, so the buyer gets a more accessible price and can easily pay via paypal.

== Description ==

As we did start a colaboration with a lawyer in Spain the idea of a simple landing page with a low and accessible price for a consultation came up. Instead of combining two or three plugins we opted for the option to created a unified one ourselves. This plugin here has been the first Version. Unfortunately this project has later on not been released so we are more than happy to get back on track in the future and see it live in action.

I would say we are still not fully done, only minor details are missing.

== Feature Overview ==

* Caluclate the price per time frame (how fast does the client want an answer)
* Caluclate the price based on complexity (how detailed and profound shall the answer for the client be) 
* Limit the amount of characters a user has to describe their legal issue or concern
* Have the user directly pay via paypal
